## Experiments

### MPT-Storywriter
- Can process up to 80k tokens (Input + Generation)

`Running MPT-Storywriter`

Set the  device map [here](https://github.com/Sleepyhead01/QMSum/blob/570abc33308f729ec42c1f6bb71d30386344185d/mpt-storywriter/mpt_generate.py#L58) according to the number of GPUs available in a node and parts of the model that you want to offload to cpu.

Write a job submission file by referring to [this](https://github.com/Sleepyhead01/QMSum/blob/main/mpt-storywriter/inf_gen.sh).
